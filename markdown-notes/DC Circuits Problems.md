# DC Circuits Problems

## Homework 1: P. 552 # 22, 24, 29 #

### 22

When the switch is opened, the equivalent resistance of the circuit increases from $\dfrac32 R + r$ to $2 R + r$. Thus the current delivered by the battery decreases, from  $\dfrac{V}{\dfrac32 R + r}$ to $\dfrac{V}{2 R + r}$.

##### Part A

Since the current decreased, **the voltage drop across $R_{left}$ will decrease**. **The voltage drop across $R_{right}$ decreases to 0**. Finally, **the voltage drop across $R_{middle}$ will increase** because there is more current as there is no current going through the $R_{right}$.

##### Part B

Current follows the same relationship as voltage as there is a fixed resistance. 

##### Part C

Since the current form the battery decreases, the terminal voltage on the battery increases but the battery’s voltage stays the same because it is a constant voltage source. 

##### Part D

$V = 9.0 V, r = 0.50 \Omega $, and $R = 5.50 \Omega $

$R_{eq} = 3/2R + r = 8.75$

$I = 9/8.75 = 1.03$

$V_{eff} = 9 - 1.03*0.5 = 8.485 V$

##### Part E

$R_{eq} = 11.5 R$

$I = 9/11.5 = 0.783$

$V_{eff} = 9 - 0.783*0.5 = 8.609 V$

basically the same as 22… do later
