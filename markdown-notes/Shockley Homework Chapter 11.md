> A fisherman’s scale stretches 3.6 cm when a 2.4-kg fish hangs from it. (a) What is the spring stiffness constant and (b) what will be the amplitude and frequency of oscillation if the fish is pulled down 2.1 cm more and released so that it oscillates up and down?

$F = -kx \Longrightarrow mg = -kx \Longrightarrow k = -\dfrac{mg}{x} = \dfrac{2.4\;\mathrm{kg}\cdot 9.8\;\mathrm{m/s^2}}{0.036\;\mathrm{m}} \approx \boxed{653\;\mathrm{N/m}}$

> A 0.25-kg mass at the end of a spring oscillates 2.2 times per second with an amplitude of 0.15 m. Determine (a) the speed when it passes the equilibrium point, (b) the speed when it is 0.10 m from equilibrium, (c) the total energy of the system, and (d) the equation describing the motion of the mass, assuming that at x was a maximum.

##### Part A

$v_{max} = A\sqrt{\dfrac{k}m} = \omega A = 2\pi fA = \boxed{2.1\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

##### Part B

$v = v_{max}\sqrt{1 - \dfrac{x^2}{A^2}} = \boxed{1.55\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

##### Part C

$E_{T} = \dfrac12 mv^2_{max} = \boxed{0.537\;\mathrm{J}}$

##### Part D

$x = 0.15\cos\left(2\pi (2.2)t\right) \Longrightarrow \boxed{x = 0.15\cos (4.4\pi t)}$

### 25

> A 1.60-kg object oscillates at the end of a vertically hanging light spring once every 0.45 s. (a) Write down the equation giving its position as a function of time Assume the object started by being compressed 16 cm from the equilibrium position (where ), and released. (b) How long will it take to get to the equilibrium position for the first time? (c) What will be its maximum speed? (d) What will be the object’s maximum acceleration, and where will it first be attained?

##### Part A

$A = 0.16\;\mathrm{m}\;\;\;//\;\;\; \omega = \dfrac{2\pi}{T} = 14.0\;\mathrm{rad/s} \Longrightarrow \boxed{y = 0.16\cos (14t)}$

##### Part B

The time to reach equilibrium = 1/4 of the period so $T_{eq} = 0.45/4 = \boxed{0.11\;\mathrm{s}}$

##### Part C

$v_{max} = A\sqrt{\dfrac{k}m} = \omega A = 0.16\cdot 2\pi\cdot \dfrac{1}{0.45} = \boxed{2.23\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

##### Part D

$a = \dfrac{kA}{m} = \omega^2 A = \boxed{31\;\mathrm{m/s^2}}$

### 28

> How long must a simple pendulum be if it is to make exactly one swing per second? (That is, one complete oscillation takes exactly 2.0 s.)

$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{\ell}{g}} \Longrightarrow \ell = g\left(\dfrac{T}{2\pi}\right)^2 = \boxed{0.99\;\mathrm{m}}$

### 30

> What is the period of a simple pendulum 47 cm long (a) on the Earth, and (b) when it is in a freely falling elevator?

##### Part A

$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{\ell}{g}} = \boxed{1.4\;\mathrm{s}}$

##### Part B

If the pendulum is in free fall, there is no tension in the string supporting the pendulum bob and no restoring force to cause oscillations as the force of gravity is not felt without the normal force. Hence, the “virtual” gravitational constant is 0, which when taken as a limit shows no bound and goes to $+\infty$. Hence, there is **no period**.
