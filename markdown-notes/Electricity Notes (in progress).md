## Electric Charge and Electric Field

- There are two kinds of ==**electric charge**==, positive and negative. These designations are to be taken algebraically—that is, any charge is plus or minus so many **coulombs** (C), in SI units. 

- Electric charge is ==**conserved**==: if a certain amount of one type of charge is produced in a process, an equal amount of the opposite type is also produced; thus **the net charge produced is zero**. 

- According to atomic theory, electricity originates in the atom, which consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Each electron has a **charge**:

- $$
  \mathbf{-e = -1.60\times 10^{-19}\;\mathbf{C}}.
  $$

- The process of touching a charged metal object with a uncharged one and the two objects end up with the same sign of charge is called ==**charging by conduction**==, or “by contact.”

- An ==**electroscope**== is a device that can be used for detecting charge. Inside a case are two movable metal leaves, often made of gold foil, connected to a metal knob on the outside. When a charge is brought to the knob, the two leaves separate due to electrostatic forces.

- Electric ==**conductors**== are those materials in which many electrons are relatively free to move, whereas electric ==**insulators**== or ==**nonconductors**== are those in which very few electrons are free to move. 

- An object is negatively charged when it has an excess of electrons, and positively charged when it has less than its normal number of electrons. The net charge on any object is a whole number times or That is, charge is ==**quantized**==. 

- An object can become charged by rubbing (in which electrons are transferred from one material to another), ==**by conduction**== (which is transfer of charge from one charged object to another by touching), or ==**by induction**== (the separation of charge within an object because of the close approach of another charged object but without touching). 

- Electric charges exert a force on each other. If two charges are of opposite types, one positive and one negative, they each exert an attractive force on the other. If the two charges are the same type, each repels the other. 

- The ==**Coulomb’s law**== states that the magnitude of the force one point charge exerts on another is proportional to the product of their charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:
  
- $$
  F = k \dfrac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2} = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2} \\
  \textsf{where}\;\;\;\; \epsilon_0 = \dfrac{1}{4\pi k} = 8.85\times10^{-12} \mathrm{\dfrac{C^2}{N\cdot m^2}}
  $$
  
- We think of an ==**electric field**== as existing in space around any charge or group of charges. The force on another charged object is then said to be due to the electric field present at its location.

- The *electric field*, $\mathbf{\vec{E}}$, at any point in space due to one or more charges, is defined as the force per unit charge that would act on a tiny positive test charge $q$ placed on that point:

- $$
  \mathbf{\vec{E}} = \dfrac{\mathbf{\vec{F}}}{q}
  $$

  

- The magnitude of the electric field a distance r from a point charge Q is

- $$
  E = \dfrac{kQ}{r^2}
  $$

- The total electric field at a point in space is equal to the vector sum of the individual fields due to each contributing charge. This is the ==**principle of superposition**==.
