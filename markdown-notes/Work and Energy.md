### Notes

$$
W = F_{||}\cdot d\text{ or }W = Fd\cos\theta
$$

$$
KE = \dfrac12mv^2
$$

$$
W_{\text{net}} = \Delta KE = \dfrac12m_2v_2^2 - \dfrac12m_1v_1^2
$$

$$
PE_G = mgy
$$

$$
PE_{\text{elastic}} = \dfrac12kx^2\text{  where  }k = \text{spring constant and }x =\text{displacement}
$$

#### Conservative vs Nonconservative Forces

 Potential energy is associated only with **conservative forces**, for which the work done by the force in moving an object from one position to another depends only on the start and end positions. **Nonconservative forces** like friction are different—work done by them does depend on the path taken and potential energy cannot be defined for them. 

#### Law of Conservation of Energy

The law states that energy can be transformed from one type to another, but the total energy remains constant. 

##### Only Conservative Forces

When only conservative forces act, the total mechanical energy is conserved: 
$$
KE + PE = \text{constant}.
$$

##### With Nonconservative Forces

When nonconservative forces such as friction act where $W_{NC}$ is the work done by nonconservative forces, then
$$
W_{NC} = \Delta KE + \Delta PE.
$$


### Example 6-2

>  (a) Determine the work a hiker must do on a 15.0-kg backpack to carry it up a hill of height as shown in Fig. 6–4a. 
>
>  (b) Determine also  the work done by gravity on the backpack.
>  (c) the net work done on the backpack. For simplicity, assume the motion is smooth and at constant velocity. 

$\Sigma F_y = m a_y$
$F_H = mg = 15\cdot 9.8 = 147\;\mathrm{N}$

$W_H= Fd\cos\theta = 147 \cdot h = \boxed{1470\;\mathrm{J}}$

$W_G = \boxed{-1470\;\mathrm{J}}$

### Example 6-3

>   Does the Earth do work on the Moon? 

It does no work on the Moon because its force acts in a perpendicular motion to the moon's velocity.

### Example 6-4

> How much net work is required to accelerate a 1000-kg car from 20 m/s to 30 m/s?

$W = KE_2 -KE_2 = \dfrac{1}{2}mv_1^2 - \dfrac{1}{2}mv_2^2 = \boxed{2.5\times 10^5\;\mathrm{J}}$

[^6-3 ]: The force of gravity does not act in the same direction as the velocity of the planet (90 deg), so the Earth would not do work on the Moon (assuming circular motion).

## Homework #1

==Class will be skipped for Saturday, so lots of questions.==

### Chapter 6 # 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51, 58, 65, 71

#### 2

> The head of a hammer with a mass of 1.2 kg is allowed to fall onto a nail from a height of 0.50 m. What is the maximum amount of work it could do on the nail? Why do people not just let if fall but add their own force to the hammer as it falls?

$W = F\cdot d = 1.2 \cdot 9.8\cdot 0.50 = \boxed{5.88\;\mathrm{J}}$

This is clearly **not enough energy** to get a nail to be used. Hence, the addition of the larger force from the user helps give a larger amount of energy to the nail, which might be helpful in the use of a nail. 

#### 9

> A box of mass 4.0 kg is accelerated from rest by a force across a floor at a rate of 2.0 $\text{m/s}^2$ for 7.0 s. Find the net work done on the box.

$F = ma = 4.0\cdot 2.0 = 8\;\mathrm{N.}$

$d = d_0 + v_0t + \dfrac12at^2 = 0 + 0 + \dfrac12(2)(7)^2= 49\;\mathrm{m.}$
$W = Fd = 8\cdot 49 = \boxed{392\;\mathrm{J}}$

#### 16

>  (a) If the kinetic energy of a particle is tripled, by what factor has its speed increased? 
>
> (b) If the speed of a particle is halved, by what factor does its kinetic energy change? 

The kinetic energy tripling leads to a $\boxed{\sqrt3}$ factor to the speed.

The speed halving lead to a $\boxed{\dfrac14}$ factor to the kinetic energy.

#### 23

> At an accident scene on a level road, investigators measure a car’s skid mark to be 78 m long. It was a rainy day and the coefficient of friction was estimated to be 0.30. Use these data to determine the speed of the car when the driver slammed on (and locked) the brakes.
>
> *Hint: Why does the car's mass not matter?*

$a = \dfrac{F_{fr}}{m} = \dfrac{\mu_k\cdot mg}{m} = 0.30\cdot -9.8 = -2.94\;\mathrm{m/s^2}$

$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a\Delta x\Longrightarrow v_0 = \sqrt{0-2(-2.94)(78)} = \boxed{21.4\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

#### 30

> A 1.60-m-tall person lifts a 1.65-kg book off the ground so it is 2.20 m above the ground. What is the potential energy of the book relative to (a) the ground, and (b) the top of the person's head? (c) How is the work done by the person related to the answers in parts (a) and (b)?

$PE = mgh = 1.65\cdot 9.8\cdot 2.20 = \boxed{35.6\;\mathrm{J}}$

$PE  = mgh = 1.65\cdot 9.8\cdot 0.6 = \boxed{9.7\;\mathrm{J}}$

The work done is the same as **part (a)** as the potential energy is calculated relative to the object's starting point. It is NOT part (b) because the object does not start at the person's head, but at the ground.

#### 37

>  A 1200-kg car moving on a horizontal surface has speed 85 km/h when it strikes a horizontal coiled spring and is brought to rest in a distance of 2.2 m. What is the spring stiffness constant of the spring? 

$KE_0 + PE_0 = \dfrac12(1200)(23.6)^2 + 0 \approx 334000$

$334000 = PE_1 + KE_1 = \dfrac12k(2.2)^2 \Longrightarrow \boxed{k = 138000}$

#### 43

> An engineer is designing a spring to be placed at the
> bottom of an elevator shaft. If the elevator cable breaks
> when the elevator is at a height h above the top of the
> spring, calculate the value that the spring constant k should have so that passengers undergo an acceleration of no more than 5.0 g when brought to rest. Let M be the total mass of the elevator and passengers.

??

#### 44

>  A block of mass m is attached to the end of a spring (spring stiffness constant k). The mass is given an initial displacement from equilibrium, and an initial speed Ignoring friction and the mass of the spring, use energy methods to find its maximum speed, and its maximum stretch from equilibrium in terms of the given quantities. 

Since there is no friction, there are only conservative forces, which means that mechanical energy is conserved or:
$$
\begin{align*}
KE_0 + PE_0 &= \dfrac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + \dfrac{1}{2}kx_0^2 &= \text{constant}\\
KE_{\text{max}} + PE_{\text{min}} &= \dfrac{1}{2}mv_{\text{max}}^2 + 0 &= \text{constant} \\
KE_{\text{min}} + PE_{\text{max}} &= \dfrac{1}{2}kx_{\text{max}}^2 + 0 &= \text{constant}
\end{align*}
$$
Setting them equal to each other as they all are equal to the constant, we find our answers:
$$
\begin{align*}
v_{\text{max}} &= \boxed{\sqrt{v_0^2 + \dfrac{kx_0^2}{m}}} \\
x_{\text{max}} &= \boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{mv_0^2}{k} + x_0^2}}
\end{align*}
$$

#### 51

> A skier traveling 11.o m/s reaches the foot of  steady upward 19 degree incline and glides 15 m up along this slope before coming to rest. What was the average coefficient of friction?

$$
\begin{align*}
W_{NC} &= \Delta KE +\Delta PE \\ 
(9.8)\cos19^\circ \cdot \mu \cdot 15 &= -\dfrac12 (11.0)^2 + (9.8\;)(15\cdot \sin 19^\circ)\\
\mu &= \boxed{0.091} \\
\end{align*}
$$

#### 58

> (a) Show that one British horsepower is equal to 746 W. 
>
> (b) What is the horsepower rating of a 75-W light bulb? 

$1\;\mathrm{hp} = 1 \cdot \dfrac{550\;\mathrm{ft\cdot lb/s}}{1\;\mathrm{hp}} \cdot \dfrac{4.45\;\mathrm{N}}{1\;\mathrm{lb}} \cdot \dfrac{1\;\mathrm{m}}{3.28\;\mathrm{ft}} = 746\;\mathrm{N\cdot m/s} = \boxed{746\;\mathrm{W}}$

$75\;\mathrm{W} \cdot \dfrac{1\;\mathrm{hp}}{746\;\mathrm{W}} \approx \boxed{0.10\;\mathrm{hp}}$

#### 65

> A 975-kg sports car accelerates from rest to in 6.4 s. What is the average power delivered by the engine? 

$P = \dfrac{\Delta KE}{t} = \dfrac{m(v_2^2 - v_1^2)}{2t} \approx \boxed{71\;\mathrm{hp}}$

#### 71

> A bicyclist coasts down a 6.0 degree hill at a steady speed of 4.0 m/s. Assuming a total mass of 75 kg (bicycle plus rider), what must be the cyclist’s power output to climb the same hill at the same speed?  

While going down: $\Sigma F_x = mg\sin\theta - F_{fr} = 0 \Longrightarrow F_{fr} = mg\sin\theta$

While going up:      $\Sigma F_x = F_p - F_{fr} - mg\sin\theta = 0\Longrightarrow F_p = F_{fr} + mg\sin\theta$

Therefore, $F_p = 2mg\sin\theta.$ Now, using $P = F_p\nu$, we get:

$P = 2mg\sin\theta\cdot\nu = 2\cdot 75\cdot 9.8 \cdot\sin 6^\circ \cdot 4 \approx \boxed{614\;\mathrm{W}.}$

#### *Interesting Question* from Class

> A 55-kg skier starts from rest at the top of a ski jump,
> point A in Fig. 6–48, and travels down the ramp. Determine the distance s to where she strikes the ground at C.

$y_{proj} = y_0 - \dfrac12gt^2$
$y_{slope} = -x\tan 30$

$y_{proj} = y_{slope} \Longrightarrow gx^2 - x(2\nu^2 \tan 30 ) - 2y_0\nu^2 = 0$

With this, slash and clash 

$x = \dfrac{(\nu^2\tan 30)\pm\sqrt{(\nu^2\tan 30)^2 + 2gy_0 \nu^2}}{g} = 100.8$ and $s \cos 30 = x$

$s = \dfrac{x}{\cos 30} = \dfrac{100.8}{\cos 30} = \boxed{116\;\mathrm{m}}$
