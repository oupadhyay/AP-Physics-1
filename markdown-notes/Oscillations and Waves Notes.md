 # Oscillations and Waves Notes

## Equations

- $I = A^2$
- $I = \dfrac{P}{4\pi r^2}$
- $A = \sqrt{\dfrac{P}{4\pi r^2}}$
- $E = \dfrac12 kA^2 =  2\pi^2 m f^2 A^2$



# Sound Notes

## Notes

- an **octave** = doubling of frequency
- The pitch is normally determined by the lowest resonant frequency, the **fundamental**, which corresponds to nodes occurring only at the ends
  - $f_n = nf_1 = n\dfrac{v}{\lambda} = n \dfrac{v}{2\ell}$
- The strings on an instrument sound differnet because they have different densities.
  - $\mu = m/\ell$
  - $v = \sqrt{F_T / \mu}$
