### 1

> Is the acceleration of a simple harmonic oscillator ever zero? If so, where?

Yes at the equilibrium position, the distance from the equilibrium goes to zero, which means that the restoring force is also zero ($F = -kx = 0$).

### 2

> Real springs have mass. Will the true period and frequency be larger or smaller than given by the equations for a mass oscillating on the end of an idealized massless spring? Explain.

The period of oscillation will be larger as the period is equal to: $2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$. If one increases the mass that is away from the equilibrium position as the spring will also stretch beyond the equilibrium. In addition, since the frequency is the inverse of the period, we can see that frequency will decrease in turn. 

### 3

> How could you double the maximum speed of a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO)?

$PE = \dfrac12 kx^2 = \dfrac12 mv^2 = KE\Longrightarrow v = \sqrt{\frac{kx^2}{m}}$

With this equation, one can double the maximum speed by dividing their mass by $4$, multiplying the spring constant by $4$, or by multiplying the starting distance by $2$.

### 4

> Estimate the stiffness of the spring in a child’s pogo stick if the child has a mass of 32 kg and bounces once every 2.0 seconds.

The period of the spring is every 2.0 seconds and the mass at the end of the spring is 32 kg. Since $P = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}},$ we get that $\dfrac{m}{\left(\frac{P}{2\pi}\right)^2} = k.$

### 5

 >A fisherman’s scale stretches 3.6 cm when a 2.4-kg fish hangs from it. (a) What is the spring stiffness constant and (b) what will be the amplitude and frequency of oscillation if the fish is pulled down 2.1 cm more and released so that
 >it oscillates up and down?

$F = -kx$
