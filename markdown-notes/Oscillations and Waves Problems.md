### 1

> Is the acceleration of a simple harmonic oscillator ever zero? If so, where?

Yes at the equilibrium position, the distance from the equilibrium goes to zero, which means that the restoring force is also zero ($F = -kx = 0$).

### 2

> Real springs have mass. Will the true period and frequency be larger or smaller than given by the equations for a mass oscillating on the end of an idealized massless spring? Explain.

The period of oscillation will be larger as the period is equal to: $2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$. If one increases the mass that is away from the equilibrium position as the spring will also stretch beyond the equilibrium. In addition, since the frequency is the inverse of the period, we can see that frequency will decrease in turn.
