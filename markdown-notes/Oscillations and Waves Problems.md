### 1

> Is the acceleration of a simple harmonic oscillator ever zero? If so, where?

Yes at the equilibrium position, the distance from the equilibrium goes to zero, which means that the restoring force is also zero ($F = -kx = 0$).

### 2

> Real springs have mass. Will the true period and frequency be larger or smaller than given by the equations for a mass oscillating on the end of an idealized massless spring? Explain.

The period of oscillation will be larger as the period is equal to: $2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$. If one increases the mass that is away from the equilibrium position as the spring will also stretch beyond the equilibrium. In addition, since the frequency is the inverse of the period, we can see that frequency will decrease in turn. 

### 3

> How could you double the maximum speed of a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO)?

$$
PE = \dfrac12 kx^2 = \dfrac12 mv^2 = KE\Longrightarrow v = \sqrt{\frac{kx^2}{m}}
$$

With this equation, one can double the maximum speed by dividing their mass by $4$, multiplying the spring constant by $4$, or by multiplying the starting distance by $2$.

### 4

> Estimate the stiffness of the spring in a child’s pogo stick if the child has a mass of 32 kg and bounces once every 2.0 seconds.

$$
f = \dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}} \longrightarrow T^2 = 4\pi^2\dfrac{m}{k}\Longrightarrow k = 4\pi^2 \dfrac{32\;\mathrm{kg}}{(2.0\;\mathrm{s})^2} = \boxed{315.8\;\mathrm{N/m}}
$$

### 5

 >A fisherman’s scale stretches 3.6 cm when a 2.4-kg fish hangs from it. (a) What is the spring stiffness constant and (b) what will be the amplitude and frequency of oscillation if the fish is pulled down 2.1 cm more and released so that it oscillates up and down?

#### Part A

$$
F = F_g = (2.4)(9.8) = -k(0.036)\Longrightarrow k = 653.333 
$$

#### Part B

Amplitude = 2.1 cm because the force of gravity essentially moves the equilibrium point 3.6 cm down. 
$$
f = \dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}} = \boxed{2.625\;\mathrm{Hz}}
$$

### 6

>  A small fly of mass 0.22 g is caught in a spider’s web. The web oscillates predominantly with a frequency of 4.0 Hz. (a) What is the value of the effective spring stiffness constant k for the web? (b) At what frequency would you expect the web to oscillate if an insect of mass 0.44 g were trapped?

#### Part A

$$
k = 4\pi^2\left(\dfrac{m}{T^2}\right) = 4\pi^2 \left(\dfrac{0.00022}{4^{-2}}\right)=\boxed{0.139\;\mathrm{N/m}}
$$

#### Part B

As shown by $f = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$, we can see that the square root of the mass varies indirectly with the frequency, so if the mass doubles, the frequency would be $2\sqrt2\;\mathrm{Hz}$.

### 7

>  A mass m at the end of a spring oscillates with a frequency of 0.83 Hz. When an additional 780-g mass is added to m, the frequency is 0.60 Hz. What is the value of m?

$$
f = \dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}\longrightarrow mf^2 = \text{constant}\Longrightarrow m (0.83)^2 = (m + 0.78)(0.60)^2\Longrightarrow \boxed{m = 0.85\;\mathrm{kg}}
$$

### 8

>  A vertical spring with spring stiffness constant 305 N/m oscillates with an amplitude of 28.0 cm when 0.235 kg hangs from it. The mass passes through the equilibrium point (y = 0) with positive velocity at t = 0. (a) What equation describes this motion as a function of time? (b) At what times will the spring be longest and shortest?

#### Part A

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = 36.026\;\mathrm{rad/s}\\
y(t) = (0.280)\sin\left[\left(36.026\;\dfrac{\text{rad}}{\text{s}}\right)t\right]
$$

#### Part B

We are looking for the maximum and the minimum of the sine function from Part A. The sine function is maximized and minimized at $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, respectively. So, the respective times are $4.36\times 10^{-2}\;\mathrm{s}$ and $1.31\times 10^{-1}\;\mathrm{s}$ with each occurring at 0.174-second intervals.

### 9

### 10

$f = \dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}\Longrightarrow k = 4\pi^2 mf^2 = 18.476\;\mathrm{N/m} = \boxed{18\;\mathrm{N/m}}$

$f = \dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}} = 1.293\;\mathrm{Hz} \approx \boxed{1.3\;\mathrm{Hz}}$

### 11

$E_{\text{pot}} = \dfrac12 E_{\text{tot}} \longrightarrow \dfrac12 kx^2 = \dfrac12 \left(\dfrac12 kA^2\right) \Longrightarrow \boxed{x = \pm \dfrac{1}{\sqrt2} A}$

### 12 

$\sum F_{\text{vert}} = kx_0 - mg \Longrightarrow T = 2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{k}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{(mg/x_0)}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\dfrac{x_0}{g}} = \boxed{0.75\;\mathrm{s}}$
