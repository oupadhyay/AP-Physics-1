$C = \pi d$
$12C = 3.5 \Longrightarrow C = 3.5/12 \Longrightarrow d = \dfrac{3.5}{12\cdot\pi} = \boxed{0.093}$

>An automobile engine slows down from 3500 rpm to 1200 rpm in 2.5 s. Calculate (a) its angular acceleration, assumed constant, and (b) the total number of revolutions the engine makes in this time.

#### Part A

$\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t$
$1200 = 3500 + \alpha (2.5) \Longrightarrow \dfrac{-2300\;\mathrm{rev/min}}{2.5 s} (\dfrac{2\pi rad}{1 rev})(\dfrac{1 min}{60 sec}) = \boxed{-96.34\;\mathrm{rad/s^2}}$

#### Part B

$\theta = \overline{\omega}t = (\dfrac{3500+1200}{2})(2.5)(\dfrac{1 min}{60 sec}) = \boxed{97.9\;\mathrm{rev}}$

#### Part A

$\alpha = \dfrac{\omega^2 - \omega_0^2}{2\theta} = \dfrac{-850^2\;\mathrm{rev^2/min^2}}{2(1250\;\mathrm{rev})} \left(\dfrac{1\;\mathrm{min}}{60\;\mathrm{s}}\right)^2 \left(\dfrac{2\pi\;\mathrm{rad}}{1\;\mathrm{rev}}\right) = \boxed{-0.50\;\mathrm{\dfrac{rad}{s^2}}}$

#### Part B

$\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t \Longrightarrow t = \dfrac{\Delta \omega}{\alpha} = \dfrac{-850\;\mathrm{rev\cdot s^2}}{-0.5\;\mathrm{rad\cdot min}} \left(\dfrac{1\;\mathrm{min}}{60\;\mathrm{s}}\right)\left(\dfrac{2\pi \;\mathrm{rad}}{1\;\mathrm{rev}}\right) = \boxed{178h\;\mathrm{s}}$

>A wheel 31 cm in diameter accelerates uniformly from 240 rpm to 360 rpm in 6.8 s. How far will a point on the edge of the wheel have traveled in this time?

$\alpha = \dfrac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{120\;\mathrm{rev/min}}{6.8\;\mathrm{s}} \left(\dfrac{1\;\mathrm{min}}{60\;\mathrm{sec}}\right) = 0.294\;\mathrm{rev/s^2}$

$\theta = \omega_0t + \dfrac12 \alpha t^2 = \left(240\;\mathrm{\dfrac{rev}{min}}\right)(6.8\;\mathrm{sec})\left(\dfrac{1\;\mathrm{min}}{60\;\mathrm{sec}}\right) +\dfrac12 \left(0.294\;\mathrm{\dfrac{rev}{s^2}}\right) \left(6.8\;\mathrm{s}\right)^2 = 34\;\mathrm{rev} $
$34\cdot C = 34\pi(31) = \boxed{33.1\;\mathrm{m}}$

### 23

>A small rubber wheel is used to drive a large pottery wheel. The two wheels are mounted so that their circular edges touch. The small wheel has a radius of 2.0 cm and accelerates at the rate of 7.2 rad/s$^2$ and it is in contact with the pottery wheel (radius 27.0 cm) without slipping. Calculate (a) the angular acceleration of the pottery wheel, and (b) the time it takes the pottery wheel to reach its required speed of 65 rpm.

#### Part A

$a_{\text{tan}}$ is equivalent for each of the wheels because there is no slipping. Therefore, $\alpha_{r} r_r = \alpha_p r_p\Longrightarrow \alpha_p = \dfrac{\alpha_r r_r}{r_p} = \boxed{0.533\;\mathrm{rad/s^2}}$

#### Part B

$\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t \Longrightarrow \dfrac{65\;\mathrm{rev/min}}{0.533\;\mathrm{rad/s^2}}\left(\dfrac{1\;\mathrm{min}}{60\;\mathrm{sec}}\right)\left(\dfrac{2\pi\;\mathrm{rad}}{1\;\mathrm{rev}}\right) = \boxed{t = 12.76\;\mathrm{s}}$

$\tau_{\text{net}} = \tau_1 + \tau_2 + \tau_3 + \tau_f$
$\tau_{\text{net}} = (35\cdot 0.12) - (28\cdot 0.24) + (18\cdot 0.24) - (0.60) =\boxed{1.2\;\mathrm{m\cdot N}}$

### 28

> <img src="../images/Problem%208-28.png" style="zoom:75%;float:right;overflow:auto;" /> The bolts on the cylinder head of the engine require tightening to a torque of $95 \;\mathrm{m\cdot N}$. If a wrench is 28 cm long, what force perpendicular to the wrench must the mechanic exert at its end? If the six-sided bolt head is 15 mm across, estimate the force applied by each of the six points of the wrench against the bolt.

#### Part A

$F = \dfrac{95\;\mathrm{m\cdot N}}{0.28\;\mathrm{m}} = \boxed{339.3\;\mathrm{N}}$

#### Part B

The radius of the bolt to each of its corner is $\dfrac{2\sqrt3}{3}\cdot \dfrac{0.015}{2}.$
Thus, when finding the force on all six, we take the torque of the wrench and divide by six times the radius:
$F = \dfrac{95}{6r} = \dfrac{95}{0.03\sqrt3} = \boxed{1830\;\mathrm{N}}$

#### Part B

The force at C has a lever arm of 1.0 m, and the force at the top has a lever arm of 2.0 m. 

$\tau = − (2.0\;\mathrm{m})(56\;\mathrm{N}) \sin 32 +(1.0\;\mathrm{m})(65\;\mathrm{N}) \sin 45 = \boxed{-13.39\;\mathrm{m\cdot N}}$

> A merry-go-round accelerates from rest to 0.68 rad/s in 34 s. Assuming the merry-go-round is a uniform disk of radius 7.0 m and mass 31,000 kg, calculate the net torque required to accelerate it.

$\alpha = \omega / t$
$\tau = I\alpha = \left(\dfrac12MR_0^2\right)\left(\dfrac{\omega}{t}\right) = \dfrac{31000\cdot (7.0^2)\cdot 0.68}{2(34)} \approx \boxed{15,200\;\mathrm{m\cdot N}}$

$\tau = I\alpha = \dfrac13M\ell^2 \dfrac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \dfrac13 (0.90\;\mathrm{kg})(0.95\;\mathrm{m})^2\left(\dfrac{(2.6\;\mathrm{rev/s})(2\pi\;\mathrm{rad})}{(1\;\mathrm{rev})(0.20\;\mathrm{s})}\right) = \boxed{22.1\;\mathrm{N\cdot m}}$

Ignore air resistance on the rod and its moment of inertia.

#### Part A

#### Part B

$\tau = r_{\perp}F = 1.2\;\mathrm{m}\cdot 0.020\;\mathrm{N} = \boxed{2.4\times 10^{-2}\;\mathrm{m\cdot N}}$

(a) If each of the three rotor helicopter blades is 3.75 m long and has a mass of 135 kg, calculate the moment of inertia of the three rotor blades about the axis of rotation. (b) How much torque must the motor apply to bring the blades from rest up to a speed of 6.0 rev/s in 8.0 s?

#### Part B

Since the force vectors perpendicular to the surface cancel out, we only care for the forces acting parallel to the surface:

$F_{TA} = m(a + g\sin\theta_\alpha)= (8.0\;\mathrm{kg})(1.00\;\mathrm{m/s^2} + 9.8\sin(32^\circ)) = \boxed{49.55\;\mathrm{N}}$
$F_{TB} = m(-a+g\sin\theta_\beta) = (10.0\;\mathrm{kg})(-1.00 + 9.8\sin(61^\circ)) = \boxed{75.71\;\mathrm{N}}$

#### Part C

$\sum\tau = (F_{TB} - F_{TA})R = \boxed{3.92\;\mathrm{m\cdot N}}$
$\sum\tau =I\alpha \Longrightarrow I = \dfrac{(\sum \tau)R}{a} = \boxed{0.588\;\mathrm{m^2\cdot kg}}$

Ignore gravity.

#### Part A

$\alpha = \dfrac{\omega^2 - \omega_0^2}{2\Delta \theta} = \dfrac{\left[\frac{26.5\;\mathrm{m/s}}{1.20\;\mathrm{m}}\right]^2}{2(4(2\pi))} = \boxed{9.70\;\mathrm{rad/s^2}}$

#### Part B

$a = \dfrac{\alpha}{R} = (9.702\;\mathrm{rad/s^2})(1.20\;\mathrm{m}) = \boxed{11.64\;\mathrm{m/s^2}}$

#### Part C

$a_c = \dfrac{v^2}{R} = \dfrac{(26.5\;\mathrm{m/s})^2}{1.20\;\mathrm{m}} = \boxed{585.2\;\mathrm{m/s^2}}$

#### Part D

> A bowling ball of mass 7.25 kg and radius 10.8 cm rolls without slipping down a lane at 3.10 m/s. Calculate its total kinetic energy.

$KE = \dfrac12\left(Mv^2 + I\omega^2\right) = \dfrac12\left((7.25\cdot (3.10\cdot0.108)^2) + \dfrac25(7.25)(3.10)^2\right) = \boxed{14.34\;\mathrm{J}}$

### 54 ==confused==

> A rotating uniform cylindrical platform of mass 220 kg and radius 5.5 m slows down from 3.8 rev/s to rest in 16 s when the driving motor is disconnected. Estimate the power output of the motor (hp) required to maintain a steady speed of 3.8 rev/s.

$P=Wt=\Delta KE\cdot t = \dfrac12 MR\omega^2t = \dfrac12(220\cdot 5.5\cdot 3.8^2\cdot 16) = \boxed{190\;\mathrm{W}}$

> A sphere of radius $r = 34.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ and mass $m = 1.80\;\mathrm{kg}$ starts from rest and rolls without slipping down a 30.0° incline that is 10.0 m long. (a) Calculate its translational and rotational speeds when it reaches the bottom. (b) What is the ratio of translational to rotational kinetic energy at the bottom? Solve generally so you can answer: (c) do your answers in (a) and (b) depend on the radius of the sphere or its mass?

#### Part A

$mgh = \dfrac12 \cdot \dfrac25mr^2\omega^2 + \dfrac12m(r\omega)^2\Longrightarrow \omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{10gh}{7r^2}} = \boxed{24.25\;\mathrm{rad/s}}$

$v = r\omega = \boxed{8.37\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

#### Part B

$\dfrac{TKE}{RKE} = \dfrac{\dfrac12 m(r\omega)^2}{\dfrac12 I\omega^2} = \dfrac{mr^2\omega^2}{\dfrac25mr^2\omega^2} = \boxed{\dfrac{5}{2}}$

#### Part C

Since $v = r\omega$, only $\omega$ depends on the radius of the sphere as the greater the radius the smaller the rotational kinetic energy as fewer rotations take place. Also, in both cases, the masses cancel so therefore the mass has no effect on the ratio of kinetic energies and the end velocities of the sphere.

>  A merry-go-round has a mass of 1440 kg and a radius of 7.50 m. How much net work is required to accelerate it from rest to a rotation rate of 1.00 revolution per 7.00 s? Assume it is a solid cylinder.

$$
W = \dfrac12 I\omega_f^2 - \dfrac12 I\omega_0^2 = \dfrac14 MR^2 \omega_f^2 = \boxed{1.63\times 10^4\;\mathrm{J}}
