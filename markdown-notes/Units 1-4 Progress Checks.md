#### Part C

(i)

**Vertical axis:** Velocity (Change in Displacement / Unit Time) (m/s)

**Horizontal axis:** Time (s)

(ii)

The graph can be analyzed to find the acceleration by finding **the slope of the line** which would be the first derivative. The first derivative looks at the change in velocity per change in time or $\dfrac{dv}{dt}$. This is equal to $\dfrac{dv}{dt} = \dfrac{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)}{dt} = \dfrac{dx}{dt^2}$ which has the units, $\mathrm{m/s^2}$, verifying our process.

#### Part D

(i)

The acceleration is to the **left** as the ball slows to a stop and reverses the direction of motion. 

(ii)

The magnitude of the acceleration when the ball bounces of the wall is **greater than** the acceleration when rolling down the ramp because of two reasons: magnitude and time. The magnitude in the change of the velocity is doubled as not only does the ball slow down to zero, but speed up in the reverse direction. Moreover, the acceleration occurs over a smaller time frame, which means the acceleration is greater as it is defined to be the change in velocity over the change in time.

### Question 2

#### Part A

(i)

Taking the upwards direction as positive:
$$
\Delta x = v_0t + \dfrac12 at^2 \Longrightarrow a = \dfrac{2\Delta x - 2v_0t}{t^2} = \boxed{-5\;\mathrm{m/s^2}}\tag{2}
$$
(ii)

$v_d > v_u$ because the initial velocity has an equivalent counterpart when the rock returns to the same elevation (100 meters above the Planet X’s surface) so as the rock travels further, it speeds up due to the acceleration as the magnitude of the velocity increases. 

#### Part B

**Acceleration Due to Gravity**: $g = \boxed{-9.8\;\mathrm{m/s^2}}$

**Time in Free Fall**: $\Delta y = v_0t + \dfrac12 at^2 \Longrightarrow 4.9t^2 - 15t-100 =0 \Longrightarrow t = \boxed{6.3\;\mathrm{s}}$

**Speed When It Reaches the Ground**: $v = v_0 + at = 15 + (-9.8)(6.3) = \boxed{-47\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

**Maximum Height**:
$$
\Delta y_{\text{max}} = h + \dfrac{v_0^2}{2g} = 111.479591\approx \boxed{110\;\mathrm{m}}
$$
With all of this, we can see that though the initial height and the initial height are the same, the great acceleration due to gravity on earth reduces the maximum height, increases its speed when it reaches the ground, and decreases the time in free fall.

## Unit 2

### Question 1

#### Part A

(i)

The block has **an upwards normal force from the ground** and **a downwards gravitational force** with the upwards force’s magnitude greater than the gravitational force’s by x Newtons. Since this block is at rest, **the net downwards force from Block 2** is equal to x Newtons. Since this diagram is relative, we can say that x = 1 “unit,” the gravitational force = 2 “units” and the normal force from the ground = 3 “units.”

(ii)

Since all the blocks are are rest, there is no acceleration of the blocks. This means that due to F = ma on the pulley system, there is no tension force in the string. Hence, the only forces are an **upwards normal force from Block 1** with magnitude x and **a downwards gravitational force** of magnitude x.

#### Part B

(i)

When $m_3 > m_2$, then the motion of block 3 is much slower as there is a smaller proportion of the mass in free fall, which causes the acceleration as there is the unbalanced force of gravity. This was previously countered by the normal force from block 3 which has now been removed. **This unbalanced force causes Block 3 to start moving to the right.**

(ii)

We can consider the entire pulley system to be in a vertical reference.
$$
\begin{align}
\sum F_x = 0 \Longrightarrow \text{all acceleration is in the y direction} \\
\sum F_y = F_{G_2} = m_2g \\
a_{\text{system}} = \dfrac{\sum F}{m_{\text{total}}} = \boxed{g\left(\dfrac{m_2 }{m_2 + m_3}\right)} \tag{system acceleration}
\end{align}
$$

#### Part C

My answer to part (b)(ii) is **consistent** with my claim in part (b)(i) as it describes an acceleration towards the ground for Block 2 and a movement to the right for Block 1 as a pulley changes the direction of the force. Hence my claim was correct that the unbalanced force serves to accelerate the blocks.

#### Part D

Assuming again that the downwards direction is positive, **the acceleration is constant and positive** (horizontal line) and **the velocity increases at a constant (linear) fashion** from left to right.

### Question 2

#### Part A

(i)

The **first dot has a net force towards the left** and the **second dot has a net force to the right** as they collide.

(ii)

The center of mass which represents the entire system does not change its velocity based on forces that occur within the system. So the center of mass is **staying the same** due to the conservation of energy within a conservative system.

#### Part B

The axes are parallel and perpendicular to the slope. 

(i)

The net force is **0 Newtons** as in the overall system, the forces parallel to the slope cancel and the forces perpendicular (gravity and the normal force) also cancel. Hence, the net force equal 0.

(ii)

Once the blocks are tilted, the normal force which is perpendicular only cancels the perpendicular component of gravity 
($mg\cos\theta$)  which leaves the parallel component to change the velocity of the system at a constant acceleration ($mg\sin\theta$). With the acceleration and the initial velocity ($v_0 = 0\;\mathrm{m/s}$), we can find the final velocity.
$$
\begin{align}
v_f &= v_0 + at \tag{kinematic equation}\\
v_f &= 0 + mg\sin\theta \cdot t = (0.40)(9.8)(0.602)\cdot 0.5 = \boxed{1.2\;\mathrm{m/s}} \tag{final velocity}
\end{align}
$$

## Unit 3

### Question 1

#### Part A

(i)

Force of gravity straight down. Tension force in the direction of the string ( up and to the left ).

(ii)
$$
\begin{align}
\sum F_y &= F_T\cos\theta - Mg = 0 \\ F_T &= \dfrac{Mg}{\cos\theta} \\
\sum F_x &= Ma_c = F_T\sin\theta \\ \dfrac{Mg\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} &= Mg \tan\theta \\
a_c  &= \boxed{g\tan\theta}
\end{align}
$$


#### Part B

(i)

$g = \dfrac{a_c}{\tan\theta} = \dfrac{mv^2}{r \tan\theta} = \dfrac{m\left(\dfrac{2\pi r}{T}\right)^2}{r \tan\theta} \tag{1}$

Hence,

| 1    | Measure the mass of the block and the length of the string. Use three trials to reduce error in the measurement. | Meterstick + Balance   | $m$ and $L$         |
| 2    | Start the motor to start the conical pendulum.               | Motor + String + Block | N/A                 |
| 3    | Measure the radius of the traveling block. Use three trials again. | Meterstick             | $r$                 |
| 4    | Start and stop the stopwatch to measure the period of the block’s motion. Use three trials. | Stopwatch              | $T$                 |
| 6    | Calculate the angle with the equality $\sin\theta = \dfrac{r}{L}$ by solving for theta. | Calculator             | $\theta$            |
| 7    | Now, plug in the values for $m$, $r$,  $T$, and $\theta$ to solve for $g$. | Calculator             | $g$                 |

#### Part C

$g =\dfrac{m\left(\dfrac{2\pi r}{T}\right)^2}{r \tan\theta} = \dfrac{4\pi^2mr}{T^2 \cdot\tan\theta } \Longrightarrow \dfrac{g}{4\pi^2} =  \dfrac{mL\cos\theta}{T^2} = \dfrac{m\ell}{T^2} \tag{2}$

(i)

Keeping the mass of the block constant, the horizontal axis is period squared and the vertical axis is length.

(ii)

The slope of the graph is shown in equation 2 to be $\dfrac{g}{4\pi^2}$, so the slope would be multiplied by $4\pi^2$ to determine $g$.

### Question 2

#### Part A

$4F_0$ for both

#### Part B

$$
\begin{align*}
\sum F_{\text{inwards}} &= F_g = m_{\text{satellite}} \cdot a_c \\
\dfrac{m_{\text{satellite}}\cdot v_t^2}{r} &= \dfrac{G\cdot m_S\cdot m_{\text{satellite}}}{r^2} \\
v_t &= \boxed{\sqrt{\dfrac{G\cdot m_S}{r}}}
\end{align*} \\
$$

With this derivation, the only factors in the speed of a satellite in orbit are the radius of the orbit from the center of mass and the mass of the star or planet that is in the “center.” Since both System A and B have stars of equal mass $M_S$, the tangential speed of Planet B is the same as that of Planet A. However, since System C has a star of mass $4M_S$, the tangential velocity of Planet C is greater than (twice) that of Planet A.
