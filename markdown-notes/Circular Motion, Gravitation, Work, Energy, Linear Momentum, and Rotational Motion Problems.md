# Circular Motion, Gravitation, Work, Energy, Linear Momentum, and Rotational Motion Problems

> On an ice rink two skaters of equal mass grab hands and spin in a mutual circle once every 2.5 s. If we assume their arms are each 0.80 m long and their individual masses are 55.0 kg, how hard are they pulling on one another?

> <img src="../images/Problem%205-16.png" style="zoom:50%;float:right;" /> The design of a new road includes a straight stretch that is horizontal and flat but that suddenly dips down a steep hill at 18°. The transition should be rounded with what minimum radius so that cars traveling 95 km/h will not leave the road (see figure)?

$F_R = mg\cos\theta - F_N = \dfrac{mv^2}{r}$
$r = \dfrac{mv^2}{mg\cos\theta - F_N}$

As the car is about the leave the road, the normal force would be zero, so we get:

$r = \dfrac{mv^2}{mg\cos\theta} = \dfrac{v^2}{g\cos\theta} = \dfrac{2638.9^2}{9.8\cdot \cos(18^\circ)} = 2831\;\mathrm{m} = \boxed{2.8\;\mathrm{km}}$

### 21

> A pilot performs an evasive maneuver by diving vertically at 270 m/s. If he can withstand an acceleration of 8.0 g’s without blacking out, at what altitude must he begin to pull his plane out of the dive to avoid crashing into the sea?

$a_R = \dfrac{v^2}{r} \Longrightarrow r = \dfrac{270^2}{8\cdot 9.8} = 929.85\;\mathrm{m} = \boxed{0.93\;\mathrm{km}}$

### 22

> If a curve with a radius of 95 m is properly banked for a car traveling 65 km/h, what must be the coefficient of static friction for a car not to skid when traveling at 95 km/h?



### 27

> A particle revolves in a horizontal circle of radius 1.95 m. At a particular instant, its acceleration is 1.05 $\text{m/s}^2,$  in a direction that makes an angle of 25.0° to its direction of motion. Determine its speed (a) at this moment, and (b) 2.00 s later, assuming constant tangential acceleration.

> Every few hundred years most of the planets line up on the same side of the Sun. Calculate the total force on the Earth due to Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn, assuming all four planets are in a line, Fig. 5–44. The masses are $m_V = 0.815 m_E,$ $m_J = 318 m_E ,$ $m_{Sat} = 95.1 m_ E$ , and the mean distances of the four planets from the Sun are 108, 150, 778, and 1430 million km. What fraction of the Sun’s force on the Earth is this?
