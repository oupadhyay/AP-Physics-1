#### 15

> A $0.145$kg baseball pitched at $31.0$ m/s is hit on a horizontal line drive straight back at the pitcher at $46.0$ m/s. If the contact time between bat and ball is $5.00\times 10^{-3}$, calculate the force (assumed to be constant) between the ball and bat. 

$\Delta p = F\Delta t = m(v_2 - v_1)$

$F = \dfrac{(0.145\;\mathrm{kg})(46.0\;\mathrm{m/s} - (-31.0\;\mathrm{m/s}))}{5.00 \times 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{s}} = \boxed{2233\;\mathrm{N}}$

> A golf ball of mass 0.045 kg is hit off the tee at a speed of 38 m/s. The golf club was in contact with the ball for 3.5 x 10$^{-3}$. Find (a) the impulse imparted to the golf ball, and (b) the average force exerted on the ball by the golf club. 

Impulse $= \Delta p = m(v_2 - v_1) = (0.045\;\mathrm{kg})(38\;\mathrm{m/s} - 0\;\mathrm{m/s}) = \boxed{1.71\;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}$

Force = $\dfrac{\textsf{Impulse}}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{1.71\;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}{3.5\times 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{s}} = \boxed{488.57\;\mathrm{N}}$

#### 17

> A 12-kg hammer strikes a nail at a velocity of 7.5 m/s and comes to rest in a time interval of 8.0 ms. (a) What is the impulse given to the nail? (b) What is the average force acting on the nail? 

Impulse $= \Delta p = m(v_2 - v_1) = (12\;\mathrm{kg})(7.5\;\mathrm{m/s} - 0\;\mathrm{m/s}) = \boxed{90 \;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}$

Force = $\dfrac{\textsf{Impulse}}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{90\;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}{8.0\times 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{s}} = \boxed{11250\;\mathrm{N}}$

#### 18

> A tennis ball of mass $m = 0.060$ kg and speed  $v = 28$ m/s strikes a wall at a 45° angle and rebounds with the same speed at 45° (Fig. 7–32). What is the impulse (magnitude and direction) given to the ball? 

Impulse = $\Delta p = \Delta p_x = m(v_{x}' - v_x) = (0.060\;\mathrm{kg})\left(14\sqrt2\;\mathrm{m/s} - \left(-14\sqrt2\;\mathrm{m/s} \right)\right) = \boxed{1.68\sqrt2\;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}$

==This is the last problem with units. The rest of the problems have ***implied*** units.==

#### 19

>  A 125-kg astronaut (including space suit) acquires a speed of 2.50 m/s by pushing off with her legs from a 1900-kg space capsule. (a) What is the change in speed of the space capsule? (b) If the push lasts 0.600 s, what is the average force exerted by each on the other? As the reference frame, use the position of the capsule before the push. (c) What is the kinetic energy of each after the push?

##### Part A

$\Delta p = 0 \Longrightarrow m_1\Delta v_1 = m_2\Delta v_2$
$\Delta v_2 = \dfrac{m_1\Delta v_1}{m_2} = \boxed{0.164}$

##### Part B

$F = ma = m \dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \boxed{520.833333\;\mathrm{N}}$

##### Part C

$KE_{A} = \dfrac12 125(2.50)^2 = \boxed{390.6\;\mathrm{J}}$

$KE_{C} = \dfrac12 1900(0.164)^2 = \boxed{25.6\;\mathrm{J}}$

> Rain is falling at the rate of 2.5 cm/h and accumulates in a pan. If the raindrops hit at 8.0 m/s, estimate the force on the bottom of a 1.0 m$^2$ pan due to the impacting rain which we assume does not rebound. Water has a mass of 1000 kg per m$^3$.

$F = \dfrac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{mv_f - mv_0}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{m}{\Delta t}(v_f - v_0) = \dfrac{\rho V}{\Delta t}v_0 = \dfrac{h}{\Delta t}\rho Av_0 = \dfrac{2.5 \times 10^{-2}}{3600}(1000)(1)(8) = \boxed{0.556\;\mathrm{N}}$

#### 25

>A ball of mass 0.440 kg moving east (+ direction) with a speed of 3.80 m/s collides head-on with a 0.220-kg ball at rest. If the collision is perfectly elastic, what will be the speed and direction of each ball after the collision?

$v_A - v_B = -(v_A' - v_B') \longrightarrow v_A + v_A' = v_B'$

$m_A v_A + m_B v_B = m_A v_A' + m_b v_B' \Longrightarrow m_A v_A = m_Av_A' + m_B(v_A + v_A')$
$\Longrightarrow v_A' = \dfrac{v_A(m_A - m_B)}{m_A + m_B} = \boxed{1.267\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball A and $v_B'=\boxed{5.067\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball B

#### 26

> A 0.450-kg hockey puck, moving east with a speed of 5.90 m/s has a head-on collision with a 0.900-kg puck initially at rest. Assuming a perfectly elastic collision, what will be the speed and direction of each puck after the collision? 

Using the formula from question 25, 
$v_A' = \dfrac{(5.8)(-0.45)}{1.35} = \boxed{-1.933\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball A and $v_B' = \boxed{3.867\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball B

#### 27

> A 0.060-kg tennis ball, moving with a speed of 5.50 m/s has a head-on collision with a 0.090 kg ball initially moving in the same direction at a speed of 3.00 m/s. Assuming a perfectly elastic collision, determine the speed and direction of each ball after the collision.

$5.5 + v_A' = 3 + v_B'\Longrightarrow 2.5 + v_A' = v_B'$
$m_Av_A + m_Bv_B = m_Av_A' + m_B\cdot 2.5 + m_Bv_A' \Longrightarrow v_A' = \dfrac{m_Av_A + m_B v_B - m_B \cdot 2.5}{m_A + m_B} = \boxed{2.5\;\mathrm{m/s}}$
$v_B = 2.5 + 2.5 =\boxed{5.0\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

#### 28

> Two billiard balls of equal mass undergo a perfectly elastic head-on collision. If one ball’s initial speed was 2.00 m/s, and the other’s was 3.60 m/s in the opposite direction, what will be their speeds and directions after the collision? 

Since the balls have equal mass, their directions and speed would swap ie. v_A = $\boxed{-3.60\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ and $v_B = \boxed{2.00\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

#### 29

> A 0.280-kg croquet ball makes an elastic head-on collision with a second ball initially at rest. The second ball moves off with half the original speed of the first ball. (a) What is the mass of the second ball? (b) What fraction of the original kinetic energy ($\Delta KE / KE$) gets transferred to the second ball? 

$v_B = 0$ and $v_B' = \dfrac12 v_A$ $\Longrightarrow -\dfrac12 v_A = v_A'$

$3 m_A = m_B = \boxed{0.840\;\mathrm{kg}}$
$\dfrac{KE'_B}{KE_A} = \dfrac{3\cdot (\dfrac12)^2}{1\cdot 1} = \boxed{\dfrac34}$

#### 30

>  A ball of mass $m$ makes a head-on elastic collision with a second ball (at rest) and rebounds with a speed equal to 0.450 its original speed. What is the mass of the second ball? 

$v_B' = v_A + v_A' = 0..550 v_A$

$m_Av_A = m_Av_A' + m_Bv_B' = m_A(-0.450v_A) + m_B(0.550v_A)$
$m_B = \boxed{2.64m_A}$

#### 33

> In a ballistic pendulum experiment, projectile 1 results in a maximum height h of the pendulum equal to 2.6 cm. A second projectile of the same mass causes the pendulum to swing twice as high, $h_2$ = 5.2 cm. The second projectile was how many times faster than the first?

From example 7-9, $\left(\dfrac{mv}{(m + M)}\right)^2 = 2gh$. Therefore, to increase the height by a factor of 2, the velocity must be increased by $\boxed{\sqrt2}$.

#### 34

> (a) Derive a formula for the fraction of kinetic energy lost, in terms of m and M for the ballistic pendulum collision of Example 7–9. (b) Evaluate for m = 18.0 g and M = 380 g.
