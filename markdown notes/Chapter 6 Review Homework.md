 Point 2: 
$PE_1 = KE_2 \Longrightarrow gh = \dfrac12 v^2 \Longrightarrow v = \sqrt{2gh} = \boxed{25.04\;\mathrm{m/s}}$
Point 3:

$PE_3 + KE_3 = KE_2 = PE_1\Longrightarrow mgh_3 + \dfrac12 mv_3^2 = mgh_1 \Longrightarrow v_3 = \sqrt{2g(h_1 - h_3)} = \boxed{10.84\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

Point 4:

$v_4 = \sqrt{2g(h_1 - h_4)} = \boxed{18.78\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

### 42

>What should be the spring constant $k$ of a spring designed to bring a 1200-kg car to rest from a speed of 95 km/h so that the occupants undergo a maximum acceleration of 4.0 g?

$\dfrac12 mv_0^2 = \dfrac12 kx_{max}^2\Longrightarrow x_{max} = v_0\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{k}}$
$F = ma_{max} = kx_{max} = \sqrt{mv_0^2k}\Longrightarrow k = \dfrac{ma_{max}^2}{v_0^2} = \boxed{2648\;\mathrm{N/m}}$ 

### 44

> A block of mass $m$ is attached to the end of a spring (spring stiffness constant $k$). The mass is given an initial displacement $x_0$ from equilibrium, and an initial speed $v_0$. Ignoring friction and the mass of the spring, use energy methods to find (a) its maximum speed, and (b) its maximum stretch from equilibrium, in terms of the given quantities

$PE_{el} + KE = \dfrac12kx_0^2 + \dfrac12mv_0^2 = \dfrac12 mv^2_{max} \Longrightarrow \boxed{v_{max} = \sqrt{v^2_0 + \dfrac{kx_0^2}{m}}}$

$PE_{el} + KE = \dfrac12kx_0^2 + \dfrac12mv_0^2 = \dfrac12 kx^2_{max} \Longrightarrow \boxed{x_{max} = \sqrt{\dfrac{mv_0^2}{k} + x_0^2}}$

### 48

>  A ski starts from rest and slides down a 28° incline 85 m long. (a) If the coefficient of friction is 0.090, what is the ski’s speed at the base of the incline? (b) If the snow is level at the foot of the incline and has the same coefficient of friction, how far will the ski travel along the level? Use energy methods.

$g\Delta h + \dfrac12 v^] = W_{NC} = (\mu_k g\cos\theta)(85) \Longrightarrow v = \boxed{25.49\;\mathrm{m/s}}$
$\dfrac12 mv^2 = \mu_k mg d\Longrightarrow d = \dfrac{v^2}{2\mu_k g} = \boxed{368\;\mathrm{m}}$

### 50

> Suppose the roller-coaster car in Fig. 6–40 passes point 1 with a speed of 1.30 m/s. If the average force of friction is equal to 0.23 of its weight, with what speed will it reach point 2? The distance is 45.0 m.

$\Delta KE +\Delta PE = W_{NC} \Longrightarrow\dfrac{v^2 - 1.30^2}{2} +32 g = 0.23g(45.0)\Longrightarrow v = \boxed{20.56\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

### 51

> A skier traveling 11.0 m/s reaches the foot of a steady upward 19° incline and glides 15 m up along this slope before coming to rest. What was the average coefficient of friction?

$\mu_k = \dfrac{(11.0)^2}{2(9.8)(15)\cos\theta} - \tan\theta = \boxed{0.091}$

### 52

> You drop a ball from a height of 2.0 m, and it bounces back to a height of 1.6 m. (a) What fraction of its initial energy is lost during the bounce? (b) What is the ball’s speed just before and just after the bounce? (c) Where did the energy go?

#### Part A

$\Delta PE = mg(2.0-1.6) = mg(0.4) = \boxed{20\%}$

#### Part B

$KE_{before} = PE_{before} \Longrightarrow v = \sqrt{2gh} = \boxed{6.3\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

$KE_{after} = PE_{after} \Longrightarrow v = \sqrt{2gh'} = \boxed{5.6\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

#### Part C

The energy “lost” was changed primarily into **heat energy**—the temperature of the ball and the ground would have increased slightly after the bounce. Some of the energy may have been changed into **acoustic energy** through sound waves upon impact and **mechanical energy** by deforming the ball. 

### 54

> A projectile is fired at an upward angle of 38.0° from the top of a 135-m-high cliff with a speed of 165 m/s. What will be its speed when it strikes the ground below? (Use conservation of energy.)

$\dfrac12 v_x^2  = \dfrac12v_x'^2 \Longrightarrow v'_x = 130.02\;\mathrm{m/s}$

$\dfrac12 v_y^2 + g(135) = \dfrac12v_y'^2 = v'_y = 113.87\;\mathrm{m/s}$

$v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \boxed{172.83\;\mathrm{m/s}}$
