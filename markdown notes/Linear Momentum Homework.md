> A $0.145$kg baseball pitched at $31.0$ m/s is hit on a horizontal line drive straight back at the pitcher at $46.0$ m/s. If the contact time between bat and ball is $5.00\times 10^{-3}$, calculate the force (assumed to be constant) between the ball and bat. 

$\Delta p = F\Delta t = m(v_2 - v_1)$

$F = \dfrac{(0.145\;\mathrm{kg})(46.0\;\mathrm{m/s} - (-31.0\;\mathrm{m/s}))}{5.00 \times 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{s}} = \boxed{2233\;\mathrm{N}}$

> A golf ball of mass 0.045 kg is hit off the tee at a speed of 38 m/s. The golf club was in contact with the ball for 3.5 x 10$^{-3}$. Find (a) the impulse imparted to the golf ball, and (b) the average force exerted on the ball by the golf club. 

Impulse $= \Delta p = m(v_2 - v_1) = (0.045\;\mathrm{kg})(38\;\mathrm{m/s} - 0\;\mathrm{m/s}) = \boxed{1.71\;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}$

Force = $\dfrac{\textsf{Impulse}}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{1.71\;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}{3.5\times 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{s}} = \boxed{488.57\;\mathrm{N}}$

Impulse $= \Delta p = m(v_2 - v_1) = (12\;\mathrm{kg})(7.5\;\mathrm{m/s} - 0\;\mathrm{m/s}) = \boxed{90 \;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}$

Force = $\dfrac{\textsf{Impulse}}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{90\;\mathrm{N\cdot s}}{8.0\times 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{s}} = \boxed{11250\;\mathrm{N}}$

(c) What is the kinetic energy of each after the push?

##### Part A

$\Delta p = 0 \Longrightarrow m_1\Delta v_1 = m_2\Delta v_2$
$\Delta v_2 = \dfrac{m_1\Delta v_1}{m_2} = \boxed{0.164}$

> Rain is falling at the rate of 2.5 cm/h and accumulates in a pan. If the raindrops hit at 8.0 m/s, estimate the force on the bottom of a 1.0 m$^2$ pan due to the impacting rain which we assume does not rebound. Water has a mass of 1000 kg per m$^3$.

$F = \dfrac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{mv_f - mv_0}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{m}{\Delta t}(v_f - v_0) = \dfrac{\rho V}{\Delta t}v_0 = \dfrac{h}{\Delta t}\rho Av_0 = \dfrac{2.5 \times 10^{-2}}{3600}(1000)(1)(8) = \boxed{0.556\;\mathrm{N}}$

>A ball of mass 0.440 kg moving east (+ direction) with a speed of 3.80 m/s collides head-on with a 0.220-kg ball at rest. If the collision is perfectly elastic, what will be the speed and direction of each ball after the collision?

$v_A - v_B = -(v_A' - v_B') \longrightarrow v_A + v_A' = v_B'$

$m_A v_A + m_B v_B = m_A v_A' + m_b v_B' \Longrightarrow m_A v_A = m_Av_A' + m_B(v_A + v_A')$
$\Longrightarrow v_A' = \dfrac{v_A(m_A - m_B)}{m_A + m_B} = \boxed{1.267\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball A and $v_B'=\boxed{5.067\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball B

#### 26

> A 0.450-kg hockey puck, moving east with a speed of 5.90 m/s has a head-on collision with a 0.900-kg puck initially at rest. Assuming a perfectly elastic collision, what will be the speed and direction of each puck after the collision? 

Using the formula from question 25, 
$v_A' = \dfrac{(5.8)(-0.45)}{1.35} = \boxed{-1.933\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball A and $v_B' = \boxed{3.867\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ for ball B

#### 27

> A 0.060-kg tennis ball, moving with a speed of 5.50 m/s has a head-on collision with a 0.090 kg ball initially moving in the same direction at a speed of 3.00 m/s. Assuming a perfectly elastic collision, determine the speed and direction of each ball after the collision.

$5.5 + v_A' = 3 + v_B'\Longrightarrow 2.5 + v_A' = v_B'$
$m_Av_A + m_Bv_B = m_Av_A' + m_B\cdot 2.5 + m_Bv_A' \Longrightarrow v_A' = \dfrac{m_Av_A + m_B v_B - m_B \cdot 2.5}{m_A + m_B} = \boxed{2.5\;\mathrm{m/s}}$
$v_B = 2.5 + 2.5 =\boxed{5.0\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

#### 28

> Two billiard balls of equal mass undergo a perfectly elastic head-on collision. If one ball’s initial speed was 2.00 m/s, and the other’s was 3.60 m/s in the opposite direction, what will be their speeds and directions after the collision? 

Since the balls have equal mass, their directions and speed would swap ie. v_A = $\boxed{-3.60\;\mathrm{m/s}}$ and $v_B = \boxed{2.00\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

#### 29

> A 0.280-kg croquet ball makes an elastic head-on collision with a second ball initially at rest. The second ball moves off with half the original speed of the first ball. (a) What is the mass of the second ball? (b) What fraction of the original kinetic energy ($\Delta KE / KE$) gets transferred to the second ball? 

$v_B = 0$ and $v_B' = \dfrac12 v_A$ $\Longrightarrow -\dfrac12 v_A = v_A'$

$3 m_A = m_B = \boxed{0.840\;\mathrm{kg}}$
$\dfrac{KE'_B}{KE_A} = \dfrac{3\cdot (\dfrac12)^2}{1\cdot 1} = \boxed{\dfrac34}$

#### 30

>  A ball of mass $m$ makes a head-on elastic collision with a second ball (at rest) and rebounds with a speed equal to 0.450 its original speed. What is the mass of the second ball? 

$v_B' = v_A + v_A' = 0..550 v_A$

$m_Av_A = m_Av_A' + m_Bv_B' = m_A(-0.450v_A) + m_B(0.550v_A)$
$m_B = \boxed{2.64m_A}$

#### 33

> In a ballistic pendulum experiment, projectile 1 results in a maximum height $h_1$ of the pendulum equal to 2.6 cm. A second projectile of the same mass causes the pendulum to swing twice as high, $h_2$ = 5.2 cm. The second projectile was how many times faster than the first?

From example 7-9, $\left(\dfrac{mv}{(m + M)}\right)^2 = 2gh$. Therefore, to increase the height by a factor of 2, the velocity must be increased by $\boxed{\sqrt2}$.

#### 34

> (a) Derive a formula for the fraction of kinetic energy lost, in terms of m and M for the ballistic pendulum collision of Example 7–9. (b) Evaluate for m = 18.0 g and M = 380 g.

$\Delta KE = \dfrac12 (m+M)v^2 - \dfrac12 mv_0^2$
$KE = \dfrac12 mv_0^2$

$\dfrac{\Delta KE}{KE} = \dfrac{\dfrac12 (m+M)v^{'2} - \dfrac12 mv^2}{\dfrac12 mv^2} = \dfrac{(m+M)\left(\dfrac{m}{M+m} v\right)^2 - mv^2}{mv^2}$
$= \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{m^2v^2}{m+M} - \dfrac{m^2v^2 + mMv^2}{m+M}\right)}{mv^2} = \boxed{\dfrac{-M}{m+M}}$

$\dfrac{\Delta KE}{KE} = \dfrac{-380}{398} = \boxed{-0.95}$

#### 35

> A 0.028-kg rifle bullet traveling 190 m/s embeds itself in a 3.1-kg pendulum hanging on a 2.8-m-long string, which makes the pendulum swing upward in an arc. Determine the vertical and horizontal components of the pendulum’s maximum displacement.

$0.028* 190 = (3.128)v' \Longrightarrow v' = 1.7$
$\dfrac12 (m+M)v'^2 = (m+M)gh\Longrightarrow v' = \sqrt{2gh} \Longrightarrow h = \dfrac{v'^2}{2g} = \boxed{0.1475\;\mathrm{m}}$

$\sqrt{2.8^2 - 0.1475^2} = \boxed{2.796\;\mathrm{m}}$

> An internal explosion breaks an object, initially at rest, into two pieces, one of which has 1.5 times the mass of the other. If 5500 J is released in the explosion, how much kinetic energy does each piece acquire?

A 3:2 ratio leads to a 2:3 ratio of kinetic energy. Therefore the $KE_A = \boxed{2200\;\mathrm{J}}$ and $KE_B = \boxed{3300\;\mathrm{J}}$

> A 980-kg sports car collides into the rear end of a 2300-kg SUV stopped at a red light. The bumpers lock, the brakes are locked, and the two cars skid forward 2.6 m before stopping.
> The police officer, estimating the coefficient of kinetic friction between tires and road to be 0.80, calculates the speed of the sports car at impact. What was that speed?

$980 v = 3280 v' \Longrightarrow v = 3.3469 v'$

> Car A hits car B (initially at rest and of equal mass) from behind while going 38 m/s. Immediately after the collision, car B moves forward at 15 m/s and car A is at rest. What fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?

$$
\textsf{Fraction Lost} = \dfrac{\Delta KE}{KE_{\textsf{initial}}} = \dfrac{v_A^2 - v'^2_B}{v_A^2} = \boxed{0.84}

> A wooden block is cut into two pieces, one with three times the mass of the other. A depression is made in both faces of the cut, so that a firecracker can be placed in it with
> the block reassembled. The reassembled block is set on a rough-surfaced table, and the fuse is lit. When the firecracker explodes inside, the two blocks separate and slide apart.
> What is the ratio of distances each block travels?

Since the force on each of the boxes are the same, then the acceleration is based solely on the individual masses. In fact, using the old displacement kinematic equation we can find that the speed is the inverse of the square of the mass. This means that the $\Delta x $  are in the ratio $\boxed{1/9}$.

> Billiard ball A of mass  $m_A = 0.120\;\mathrm{kg}$ moving with speed $v_A = 2.80 \;\mathrm{m/s}$ strikes ball B, initially at rest, of mass $m_B = 0.140\;\mathrm{kg}$. As a result of the collision, ball A is deflected off at an angle of 30.0° with a speed $v'_A = 2.10 \;\mathrm{m/s}$. (a) Taking the x axis to be the original
> direction of motion of ball A, write down the equations expressing the conservation of momentum for the components in the x and y directions separately. (b) Solve these equations for the speed, $v'_B$, and angle, $\theta_B'$, of ball B after the collision. Do not assume the collision is elastic.

In the x direction: $0.120 \cdot 2.8 = 0.120 \cdot  1.82 + 0.140 \cdot v'_B\cos\theta_B' \Longrightarrow v_B'\cos\theta_B' = 0.84$
In the y direction: $0 = 0.120 \cdot 1.4 + 0.140\cdot v_B'\sin\theta_B' \Longrightarrow v_B'\sin\theta_B' = -1.2$
Now find theta: $\dfrac{\sin\theta_B'}{\cos \theta_B'} = -\dfrac{10}{7}\Longrightarrow \theta_B' = \boxed{-55^\circ}$
Now find velocity: $v_B' = \boxed{1.466\;\mathrm{m/s}}$

The electron and neutrino are emitted at right angles and have momenta of $9.6\times 10^{-23}\;\mathrm{kg\cdot m/s}$ and $6.2\times 10^{-23}\;\mathrm{kg\cdot m/s}$ respectively. Determine the magnitude and the direction of the momentum of the second (recoiling) nucleus.

Since there was no momentum before the decay, the three momenta shown must add to 0 in both the x and y directions.

> A uniform circular plate of radius 2R has a circular hole of radius R cut out of it. The center of the smaller circle is a distance 0.80R from the center C of the larger circle, Fig. 7–41. What is the position of the center of mass of the plate? 

$x_{CM} = \dfrac{m_{shaded}x_{shaded} + m_{white}v_{white}}{m_{total}}\Longrightarrow x_{shaded} = \dfrac{m_{total}x_{CM} - m_{white}v_{white}}{m_{total} - m_{white}}$

Since $x_{CM} = 0$, $x_{shaded} = \dfrac{-m_{white}x_{white}}{m_{total} - m_{white}} = \dfrac{-\rho \pi R^2 (0.80R)}{\rho\pi(2R)^2 - \rho\pi R^2} = \boxed{-0.27R}$
